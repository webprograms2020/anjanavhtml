<br>
<p>Naalukettu is a Malayalam novel written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair. Published in 1958, it was MT's first major novel.
The title attributes to NƒÅlukettu, a traditional ancestral home (Taravad) of a Nair joint family.
Like many other novels written by MT, Naalukettu is also set against the backdrop of the crumbling matrilineal order of Kerala in a newly independent India.
        <br> Naalukettu is a veritable depiction of the matriarchal social order of Kerala's Nair community in its final gasp for life.
 The hero Appunni is a scion of a once rich and powerful family.Appunni is the son of a woman who married a man of her own choices and 
who did not marry the man whom her Karnavar suggested. So she has to leave the family with her son and Appunni grows up without a father and
away from the prestige and protection of the matrilineal home to which he belongs. The novel captures the traumas and psychological graph of Appunni,
an introvert and angry youth, aspiring to avenge the insult meted out to him in a matrilineal family by building a new edifice on the ruins of his ancestral home.
